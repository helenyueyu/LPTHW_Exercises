# Classes in Python

Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 

Python classes extend those found in C++ and Modula-3. Classes are created at runtime, and can be modified after creation. In C++ terminology, normally class members are public, and are virtual. 

## Python Scopes and Namespacees

A <b>namespace</b> is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are implemented as Python dictionaries. Nomrally, module namespaces last until the interpreter quits. 

A <b>scope</b> is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible.
