This is something just for my self-reference (since I'm using the VIM editor...I need to remember shortcuts). 

To go to the end of the file: `<ESC> then <SHIFT> + G`
To move down one line and create a new one: `o`

To edit: `i`
Command mode: `Esc`
Save: `:w`
Quit: `:q!`

This is a repository which holds the exercises to the textbook Learn Python the Hard Way (LPTHW).
